This app is made to connect farmers directly to retailers and thus reducing the concept of middleman. It connects farmers directly to the retailers to lower the gap of supply and demand that is retailer can talk to farmer by saying what crop is in demand and farmer can talk to retailer regarding what crop he is planning to harvest.
